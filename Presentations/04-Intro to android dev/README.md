## General Info
The `Intro to android dev.pdf` file contains the presentation slides that were used during the event. The `/res` dir contains some of the diagrams & images
used within the presentation for a better viewing experience, and the `LazyColumnGDSC` project is a simple android studio project showcasing how simple
it is to create a RecyclerView like layout in Compose compared to the view system!
